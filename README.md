# Historical Image Benchmark.

This benchmark aims to help understand the ability of large models
 to reason and critically discuss historically sensitive and complex imagery.

The benchmark was curated from a publicly available dataset of Wikipedia images
  [Wikipedia-based Image Text](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit)
 (a publicly available wikipedia images dataset). We
 develop a process to:
 - curate historically significant search terms of events, figures, and locations
 - apply additional filtering steps for quality and validation reasons.
 - collect human annotations for each image, where annotators conduct research
 and provide a short description of the historical context necessary to
 understand the central event, figure, or location in the image.

## Installation
